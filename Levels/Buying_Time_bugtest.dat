briefing{
Are you ready for a challenge, Cadet?

The scanners aboard LMS Explorer has picked up a cave system rich in energy crystals, however due to recent teleporter malfunctions we're unable to teleport down there.

We've had to set up base in an connected cavern elevated far above it, which borders a vast underground lake, so you need to tread very carefully. This cavern is however scarce on energy crystals apart from some seams scattered throughout.

The base is situated next to a temperamental stream of water, which causes periodic blackouts due to flooding.

On top of this we're unable to build any further support stations due to missing parts, so you must keep the one you have intact. There should however be an abandoned flooded base far to the south east, but the path is riddled with hard rock, so it will take time getting there.

You need to buy time until you have gathered enough energy crystals to construct a Super Teleport and a Tunnel Transport, then you need to exit the cavern via the waterfall.
}
briefingsuccess{
Well done, Cadet! You made it out of the precarious cavern in one piece!
}
briefingfailure{
It seems this was too much for you, Cadet... This is a grave setback, we are in dire need of a vast amount of energy crystals....
